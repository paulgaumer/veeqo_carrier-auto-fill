# Veeqo Carrier Auto-fill - Chrome extension

This extension quickly fills in the `Add a new carrier` form in Veeqo. It only works for Fedex for now.

## How to use it locally

### Credentials

Fill in the Fedex credentials in the VALUES section in `popup.js`.

### Load in Chrome

- Open Chrome and go to `about:extensions`.
- Click on `Load unpacked`.
- Go to the extension folder and double-click on the `manifest.json` file.
- A small `Veeqo` logo should appear in your extension bar, displaying a popup on click. Click `Fedex` to fill in the form.
- Remember to reload the extension everytime you update the code.
